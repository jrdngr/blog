Oh hello there! Long time no blog.

It's been 3 years since I wrote a few blog posts about my experience learning Rust. Since then, I've been using Rust for just about every project I have outside of work. It even weaseled its way into a few of my dev tools at work, and now we even have a new service that's written in Rust. You might say that I'm a fan.

I've been meaning to write some learning material for a long time. There are plenty of resources for beginners, but there's isn't much out there for people who are know the basics but aren't quite ready to jump into their own projects. I'm the kind of person that will just bash my head against a problem until I figure it out, but a lot of people aren't and there aren't a ton of resources out there for those people. The [2019 survey][rust-survey-2019] came to the same conclusion.

Last year my coworker found a blog post about hiding messages in PNG files. I made it about sentence in before I closed it and ran off to figure it out myself. I wrote a little command line tool in Rust and he wrote a script in Kotlin, and then we had some fun on Slack. It's always been one of my favorite Rust repos because it's small and mostly self-contained. It was also a lot of fun to write and a lot of fun to play with after it was done. I decided it would be perfect for an intermediate tutorial.

[Check it out][pngme-book] if you're sitting in that intermediate space and wondering what to do next.
